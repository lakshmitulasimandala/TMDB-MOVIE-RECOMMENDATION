# üé¨ TMDB Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to my movie recommendation engine! This project uses real-world data from TMDB (The Movie Database) to recommend similar movies based on what you've already liked. Whether you're into action-packed thrillers or heartwarming dramas, this system will help you discover your next favorite.
